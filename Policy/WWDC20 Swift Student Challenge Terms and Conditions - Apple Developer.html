						<p>You must agree to these WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge Terms 
and Conditions (the “Terms”) in order to submit your information to the 
WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge (the "Challenge"). If you do not agree 
with these Terms, do not submit. By submitting your information, you 
agree to be bound by all the Terms.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Deadlines</strong>
    <br>Challenge submissions are due by Sunday, May 17, 2020 at 11:59 
p.m. PDT. Apple is not responsible for lost or late submissions, or for 
electronic transmission errors, regardless of cause. Applicants can view
 their status on June 16, 2020 by signing in to&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/swift-student-challenge/apply/" target="_blank">developer.apple.com/wwdc20/swift-student-challenge/apply</a> with the Apple ID used for submission.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Application Eligibility Requirements</strong>
    <br> To be eligible to submit your information to the Challenge, you must:
    <br>
    </p><ul>
        <li>Be 13 years of age or older, or the equivalent minimum age 
in the relevant jurisdiction (for example, 16 years of age in the 
European Union);</li>
        <li>Be registered for free with Apple as an Apple developer or be a member of the Apple Developer Program; and</li>
        <li>Fulfill one of the following requirements:<ul>
            <li>Be enrolled in an accredited academic institution or official homeschool equivalent;</li>
            <li>Be enrolled in a STEM organization's educational curriculum;</li>
            <li>Be enrolled in an Apple Developer Academy; or </li>
            <li>Have graduated from high school or equivalent within the
 past 6 months and be awaiting acceptance or have received acceptance to
 an accredited academic institution.</li>
        </ul>
    </li></ul>
<br>
A STEM organization is any organization with a membership program that 
teaches science, technology, engineering, or math outside of a regular 
school curriculum and is legally recognized as a nonprofit organization.
<br><br>
Void where prohibited by law. Eligibility is subject to verification by 
Apple, and you agree to cooperate with Apple to provide information 
about your educational and membership status, as applicable. Employees, 
interns, affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotional agencies 
of Apple Inc. are ineligible for the Challenge, as well as immediate 
family members and/or those living in the same household of such 
parties.
<br><br>
Legal guardians of developers under 13 years of age, or the equivalent 
minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction (for example, under 16 years of
 age in the European Union) may request permission for their child to 
apply by sending an email to <a href="mailto: swiftstudentchallenge@apple.com">swiftstudentchallenge@apple.com</a>. Permission may be granted at Apple's discretion.
<p></p>

<p>
    <strong>Submission Requirements</strong>
    <br>
    </p><ul>
        <li>You must complete all required fields on the submission form and upload all required files and documentation before submitting.</li>
        <li>You must provide a PDF, PNG, or JPG of your current class 
schedule or other current proof of enrollment and the contact 
information for your dean or principal. Documentation is accepted in all
 languages and must clearly show your name, the organization or school 
name, and the dates for which it is valid.</li>
        <li>Your Swift playground must be fully functioning, and be 
written in and run on Swift Playgrounds 3.3 on iPadOS 13.4.1, Swift 
Playgrounds 3.3 on macOS 10.15.4, or Xcode 11.4.1 on macOS 10.15.4. If 
it runs on iPadOS, it must be optimized to display properly on all 
models of iPad Pro. You may incorporate the use of Apple Pencil. Xcode 
projects will not be considered. </li>
        <li>Your Swift playground must either be created by you, as an 
individual, or be based on a Swift Playgrounds template modified by you 
as an individual. Groupwork will not be considered. You may include 
third-party open source licensed code and/or public domain images and 
sounds, with credit and an explanation of why it was used.</li>
        <li>Submissions will be judged offline. Your Swift playground 
should not rely on a network connection and any resources used in your 
Swift playground should be included locally in your .zip file.</li>
        <li>You must provide an essay answer written by you for all required questions in the submission form.</li>
        <li>You must comply with the terms of the Swift Playgrounds Software License Agreement when creating your Swift playground.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    You may only provide one submission per person for the Challenge and
 only one award will be given per person. Submissions are only accepted 
through the form available at&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/swift-student-challenge/apply/" target="_blank">developer.apple.com/wwdc20/swift-student-challenge/apply</a> and will not be accepted through any other channel or after the submission deadline.
<p></p>

<p>
    <strong>Information Submitted to Apple Not Deemed Confidential</strong>
    <br>Apple works with many software developers and some of their 
products may be similar to or compete with the Swift playground you 
submit. Apple may also be developing its own similar or competing apps, 
playgrounds, products or services or may decide to do so in the future. 
To avoid potential misunderstandings, Apple cannot agree, and expressly 
disclaims, any confidentiality obligations or use restrictions, express 
or implied, with respect to your submission or any information that you 
provide in connection with your submission (“Applicant Disclosures”). 
You agree that all such Applicant Disclosures will be non-confidential. 
Submitting a Swift playground as part of this submission does not grant 
Apple any ownership interest in your submission, and you retain your 
rights in your submission.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Judging</strong>
    <br> All decisions made by the judges are final and scoring is confidential. Submissions will be judged on:
    <br>
    </p><ul>
        <li>Technical accomplishment in the submitted Swift playground;</li>
        <li>Creativity of ideas in the submitted Swift playground; and</li>
        <li>Content of written responses to the questions in the submission form.</li>
    </ul>
<p></p>

<p>
    <strong>Reasons for Disqualification</strong>
    <br> Your submission may not be considered for the Challenge if it 
does not satisfy all eligibility and submission requirements or if it 
meets any of the conditions listed below:
    </p><ul>
        <li>Your Swift playground does not function during the judging process.</li>
        <li>Your submitted Swift playground was not built by you or was 
built by more than one person. Group work will not be considered. 
Plagiarized work will not be considered and may disqualify you from 
future challenge or scholarship opportunities.</li>
        <li>Your Swift playground requires sign in.</li>
        <li>You track and/or insert analytics code in your Swift playground meant to identify or track any usage of the judges.</li>
        <li>You submit the same Swift playground that you submitted previously, with minimal or no changes.</li>
    </ul>
<br>
In addition, Apple reserves the right to disqualify your current and/or 
future submission, or withhold or revoke your award at any time if:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>You submit your information to the Challenge more than once. Each person is only allowed one submission;</li>
        <li>Any part of your submission is untrue, plagiarized, or fabricated;</li>
        <li>You engage in or previously engaged in harassment or other 
harmful behavior directed at Apple, Apple employees, other applicants, 
or WWDC attendees;</li>
        <li>You, directly or indirectly, commit any act intended to 
interfere with the Challenge, including but not limited to falsely 
discrediting other applicants to increase your chance of receiving an 
award or by contacting Apple employees to request more favorable 
treatment of your submission; or</li>
        <li>You (or your submission) fail to comply with these Terms.</li>
    </ul>
<p></p>

<p>
    <strong>Awards</strong>
    <br>Each student selected for a Challenge award will receive a 
WWDC20 jacket and pin set, subject to these Terms. In addition, one year
 of individual membership in the Apple Developer Program will be 
assigned free of charge to eligible accounts of recipients who have 
reached the age of majority in their region. This membership will start 
on July 1, 2020 for eligible accounts that do not already have an 
individual membership in the Apple Developer Program. For eligible 
accounts that already have an individual membership in the Apple 
Developer Program, the membership will be renewed free of charge for one
 year once the current membership expires. Recipients who have not yet 
reached the age of majority in their region can contact Apple once they 
reach the age of majority and request to have their membership enabled. 
 Up to three hundred and fifty (350) awards will be given at Apple’s 
sole discretion. Only one award will be given per recipient. There will 
be no substitution of awards and no cash awarded in lieu of the WWDC20 
jacket, pin set, or Apple Developer Program membership. Apple is not 
responsible for lost or damaged awards. All applicable taxes or fees are
 the sole responsibility of the recipient.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Photo and Video Consent</strong>
<br>
Photographs and video taken as part of the Challenge (e.g., interview of
 an award recipient) or as part of WWDC20 by Apple, or others on behalf 
of Apple, may include your voice, image, or likeness.  By submitting 
your information to the Challenge, you agree that Apple may use such 
photographs, and video, including those that may contain your voice, 
image, or likeness, for Apple Worldwide Developer marketing and App 
Store purposes in connection with the Challenge on a worldwide basis in 
perpetuity, without any compensation to you, and you release Apple from 
all liability related thereto.</p>
<p>
    <strong>General Terms</strong>
    <br>All federal, state, and local laws and regulations apply. By 
submitting your information to the Challenge, you agree to hold Apple 
and its directors, officers, employees and assigns, harmless against any
 and all claims and liability arising out of your submission to the 
Challenge and/or acceptance of the Challenge award. You assume all 
liability for any injury or damage caused, or claimed to be caused, by 
participation in the Challenge or use/redemption of the award. You agree
 to be bound by these Terms and the decisions of the judges, which are 
final in all respects. You agree that Apple shall not be responsible for
 any typographical or other errors in the administration of the 
Challenge.</p>
